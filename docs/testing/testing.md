## Bugs
During development and manual testing process, a number of bugs were identified. These are summarised below: those what were identified and fixed, and those that are not yet foxed but would be rectified with further development.

## Fixed Bugs 
| Problem | Solution | Result |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Gallery page: Slow to load | Gallery image files resized for web viewing | Reduced file szes no loner results in unacceptable delay in page download |
| Contact page: Users were able to submit the contact form without ticking the "Yes, I'm a Human" confirmation box. | Error identified - required attribute was attached to label rather than checkbox. This was corrected. | User is now prompted to check the box if they fail to do so, and form submission will oly be successful when all fields are complete.  |
| | | |

## Unfixed Bugs 
(check accessibility with device settings, eg dark mode)

| Issue | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Contact form data currently not used | This is a limitation of the currently project. Fixing this would be completed under future development. |
