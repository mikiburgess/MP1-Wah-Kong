## Introduction

## User Experience (UX)
This website showcases Wah Kong II, a classic wooden yacht currently moored in Weymouth, UK. Originally built in 1958, due to her age and construction she is of potential interest to the classic boat community.
She's been with her current owner since 2004, but at some point in the future she may need to be sold to a new owner. After discussion with the current owner it was decided that a website would be useful for communicating with various sailing communities, 
such as the classic boat community, and assist in her sale at some undefined point in the future.

From this initial discussion with the yacht's owner, a number of potential users and user stories were identified.

### User Stories

Individuals/companies interested in booking attendance at an event/regatta: 
- As an Event Organiser, I want to quickly and easily get an an overview of the history and build of the boat so that I can determine whether it's right for the event.

Companies looking for a classic boat for hire (TV/Film/Photography):
- As a Filmmaker/Photographer, I want to be able to see a variety of images so that I can determine whether the yacht may be a suitable candidate for the production and therefore worth reviewing on site.

*FUTURE* Potential owners: 
- As a Potential New Owner, I want to read about the specifications, construction and history, be able to view photos of various elements of the the yacht, so that I can determine whether she may be suitable for me therefore worth reviewing on site.

##### YACHT OWNER
- As the Owner, I want to be able to showcase my yacht so that anyone interested in her (national and international) can find out more and contact me directly.
- As the Owner, I want to advertise the yacht for potential commercial work, in order to raise fund for her maintenance.
- As the Owner, I want to be able to inform potential buyers of her details so that, in the future, I will be able to sell her to a classic yacht enthusiast.

### Site Elements
Considering the above user stories and the milestone 1 project requirements, the following elements to be included in the site were identified:
- Overview of dimensions, construction and history
- Gallery showcasing the yacht herself and views from the yacht whilst at sea.
- Enquiry form for site visitors to request information regarding features/history, bookings and/or availability.
Plus, if time allows post-mvp (minimal viable product):
- Overview of her appearance in the movie ['On Chesil Beach'](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667321/)
