## Introduction

## User Experience (UX)
This website showcases Wah Kong II, a classic wooden yacht currently moored in Weymouth, UK. Originally built in 1958, due to her age and construction she is of potential interest to the classic boat community.
She's been with her current owner since 2004, but at some point in the future she may need to be sold to a new owner. After discussion with the current owner it was decided that a website would be useful for communicating with various sailing communities, 
such as the classic boat community, and assist in her sale at some undefined point in the future.

From this initial discussion with the yacht's owner, a number of potential users and user stories were identified.
